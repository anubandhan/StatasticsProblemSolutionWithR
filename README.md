# StatasticsProblemSolutionWithR
To solve Statistics problem with R


Problem statement for Stats:


Statistical Computing Org published Flight records in and out from US between 1987 – 2008. Its more than 12 GB of data that cannot be loaded into memory for processing. Main idea is how to play with data to get valuable insights.

Though this course was specific to Statistics, I read R in parallel so I can utilize knowledge of both to come up with solutions.  
 
Following information needs to be analyzed using R:
1. Standard deviation: Check the standard deviation of distance travelled by American Airlines (AA)
2. Plot using R: Draw a boxplot of unique carrier distance with distance.
3. Plot using R: Direction of relationship between arrDelay and DepDelay by drawing a scattered plot.
4. Probability: What is the probability that a flight which is landing/taking off is “WN” Airlines
5. Probability: What is the joint probability of a flight getting cancelled and is supposed to travel less than 2000 miles given that the flight is “AA” Airlines.
6. Prediction: Suppose arrival delays of flights belonging to “AA” are normally distributed with mean 15 minutes and standard deviation 3 minutes. If the “AA” plans to announce a scheme where it will give 50% cash back if their flights are delayed by 20 minutes, how much percentage of the trips “AA” is supposed to lose this money.
7. Prediction: Assume that 65% of flights are diverted due to bad weather through the Weather System. What is the probability that in a random sample of 10 flights, 6 are diverted through the Weather System.
8. Linear regression: Do linear regression between the Arrival Delay and Departure Delay of the flights.
9. Multiple liner regression: Perform a multiple linear regression between the Arrival Delay along with the Departure Delay and Distance travelled by flights.
